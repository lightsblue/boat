## 6. Control System
- **RC Backup Control**: FlySky FS-i6 2.4GHz 6-Channel Transmitter/Receiver - Optional addition, not in initial budget
- **Manual Control Range**: ~300 meters (with standard RC system when added later)
- **Autonomous Control**: 100% via pre-programmed waypoints

## 7. Software Architecture
- **Platform**: Arduino framework on ESP32
- **Navigation Logic**:
  - Simple PID controller for heading correction
  - Waypoint following with 5m acceptance radius
  - Differential thrust control for steering
- **Telemetry Protocol**: Custom lightweight protocol over LoRa:
  - GPS coordinates (12 bytes)
  - Battery voltage (2 bytes)
  - System status (1 byte)
  - Current waypoint (1 byte)

## 8. Assembly Details
- **Hull Separation**: 12" center-to-center
- **Overall Dimensions**: 24" length x 16" width x 8" height
- **Weight**: Approximately 2.5kg fully assembled
- **Waterproofing**: Marine silicone sealant for all through-hull connections
- **Motor Depth**: Motors positioned with propellers 2" below waterline

## 9. Cost Breakdown
- Motors (2x): $40.00
- ESCs (2x): $24.98
- ESP32 Controller: $8.99
- GPS Module: $12.99
- IMU/Compass: $9.99
- LoRa Communication: $19.99
- Battery: $29.99
- Waterproof Box: $9.99
- PVC Pipe & Plywood: ~$10.00
- Misc Hardware: ~$8.00
- **Total**: $174.93

## 10. Optional Components (Within Budget Constraints)
- **Hull Material Alternative**: 3" PVC instead of 4" to save weight (-$5)
- **Motor Alternative**: Single motor with rudder system instead of differential thrust (-$20)
- **Power Alternative**: USB Power Bank with voltage step-up (-$10)
- **Communication Alternative**: Basic NRF24L01+ modules with range extender for shorter range testing (-$15)

With these optimizations, the total cost could be reduced to approximately $125.
