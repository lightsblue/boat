## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Favor simple solutions over complex ones. Avoid unnecessary subsystems.
- **Time to build should be fast**: Favor simplicity also to optimize for time to build this out.
- **Reliable Commodity Parts**: Choose widely available, well-supported components with a track record of durability.
- **Cost Conscious**: Keep the overall cost low; consider creative materials (e.g. PVC pontoons for the hull).
- **Software-Leveraged**: Where possible, use software to reduce hardware complexity. Custom code is preferred over over-engineered hardware solutions.
- **Engineer-Friendly**: The project should be approachable and debuggable for a generalist software engineer comfortable in Python, Node.js, or similar.

## üõ•Ô∏è Self-Guided RC Boat ‚Äî Requirements

### 1. Mission
- Autonomously travel a predefined GPS route of up to 10 miles
- Furthest point will be 5 miles away. From where I will be on the lake, at some points land that's up to 100ft in elevation off the surface of the lake will be in the way.
- No need for obstacle avoidance or real-time course corrections beyond GPS navigation
- Failsafe behavior - stop if GPS lost
- it will operate on a lake that's about 7mi long overall and has some islands
- max budget should be $100
- LATER possible additions - it should be possible to add a camera later if I decided to

### 2. Navigation
- Follow a sequence of GPS waypoints
- Maintain reasonable heading accuracy between points
- Basic manual operation should be possible when i'm in close proximity (can be sloppy - only for simple testing)
- There should be basic high latency communication between me and the boat - e.g. 30s ping of gps and battery level back to me
- Within 5m of waypoint is acceptable

### 3. Propulsion
- Use two independent motors for differential thrust steering
- Maintain consistent forward motion over long distance

### 4. Power
- Carry onboard power sufficient for at least 5 miles of operation
- Support for multi-hour continuous runtime

### 5. Telemetry (Optional)
- Low-bandwidth, long-range (‚â•10 miles) connection for:
  - Location updates
  - Basic system health (e.g. battery level)
  - Simple remote commands (e.g. stop/return)

### 6. Form Factor
- Parts of hull(s) or electronics enclosure, or other parts may be be custom 3D printed
- Compact, water-resistant design suitable for flatwater environments

# Parts that we'll work from
Since some parts are make or break, these will be fixed.
